#This is making a univariate plot with numeric data

```{r}
#Load College Scorecard
library(readxl)
college_scorecard_19_20 <- read.csv("C:/Users/thoma/OneDrive/Desktop/543_coursework/Univariate Number Plot/college scorecard_19-20.csv")
View(college_scorecard_19_20)
```
```{r}
#load ggplot
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
#load tidyvere
library(tidyverse)
```

##Creating a piot table that lists the number of higher education institutions in a state/territory
```{r}
colleges_state <- college_scorecard_19_20 %>%
  select(INSTNM, CITY, STABBR) %>%
  mutate(college_count = 1)
colleges_by_state <- aggregate(data=colleges_state,
                         college_count~STABBR,
                         FUN=sum)
```


##Put in decreasing order
```{r}
colleges_by_state=colleges_by_state[order(-colleges_by_state$college_count),]
head(colleges_by_state,10)
```

##Add percent, cummulative percent, and cummulative count:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
colleges_by_state$percent=colleges_by_state$college_count/sum(colleges_by_state$college_count)
colleges_by_state$percentcum=cumsum(colleges_by_state$percent)
colleges_by_state$Colleges.Cum=cumsum(colleges_by_state$college_count)

#see if it works
head(colleges_by_state,20)
```

#Initial graph with the states in ascending order of the total
```{r}
base = ggplot(data=colleges_by_state,
              aes(x=STABBR, Colleges.Cum)) + theme_classic()
base2 = base + scale_x_discrete(limits = colleges_by_state$STABBR)
bar2 = base2 + geom_bar(stat = "identity")
bar2 = bar2 + coord_flip()
bar2
```



```{r}
# altering previous base3
base3=base2+scale_x_discrete(limits=CountyCount_LR$County)
#scale_x_discrete. ggplot respects the order of the county in that dataframe, you cannot do that if u cannot change the parameters, scale_x_discrete. changes which goes first. we are accumulating.
bar2=base3  +geom_bar(stat = "identity")
bar2=bar2 + coord_flip() 
bar2
```
